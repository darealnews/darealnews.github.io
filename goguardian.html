<p> <font></font><font></font>Recently, teachers have begun using GoGuardian, a service for Chromebooks, designed to make monitoring<br/> and censorship easier. Teachers and administrators can easily flag and block sites, and monitor individual students browsing behaviour. This, of<br/> course, is a violation of the fourth amendment, protecting against unlawful searches and seizures. While we fight against this malicious, unlawful software,<br/> it is best that every student be informed of its dangers.
    First, administrators have access to the dashboard, which shows a pie-chart of all sites visited, and <br/>a list of the number of searches, YouTube videos watched, and online users. At the bottom, it shows the number of total hours visited to each site. Administrators can block any of the sites. Further down, there is a list of students who have attempted to access blacklisted sites. If teachers or administrators want to access blacklisted sites, they can simply enter a password, and then they are in. The administrators will also see which students attempted to access blocked sites.
    All this comes at a price of about $7 per computer, a huge waste of money on the districtâ€™s part. This money could be used to pay for nearly anything, like textbooks or classrooms, but instead our administration has wasted thousands of dollars on internet censorship.
