<h1>Teachers Upgrade to New Censorship Tools</h1><br/>by Jeff Reich on May 05 2017<p>
 Recently, teachers have begun using GoGuardian, a  service for Chromebooks, designed to make monitoring and censorship easier. Teachers and administrators<br/> can easily flag and block sites, and monitor individual students  <br/> browsing behaviour. This, of course, is a violation of the fourth amendment,<br/> protecting against unlawful searches and seizures. While we fight <br/> against this malicious, unlawful software, it is best that every student be<br/> informed of its dangers. First, administrators have access to the dashboard<br/>, which shows a pie-chart of all sites visited, and a list of the number<br/>  of searches, YouTube videos watched, and online users. At the bottom,<br/> it shows the number of total hours visited to each site. Administrators<br/> can block any of the sites. Further down, there is a list of students<br/> who have attempted to access blacklisted sites. If teachers or administrators<br/> want to access blacklisted sites, they can simply enter a password, and then they are in. The administrators will also see which students attempted to <br/> access blocked sites. All this comes at a price of about $7 per computer<br/>, a huge waste of money on the districtâ€™s part. This money could be used<br/> to pay for nearly anything, like textbooks or classrooms, but instead<br/> our administration has wasted thousands of dollars on internet censorship.<br\>
